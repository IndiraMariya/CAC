        <h2 class="font-medium text-4xl">Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            At Double Scoop, our mission is clear: we're dedicated to empowering young minds by equipping them with the tools they need to critically evaluate news content.

        <h2 class="font-medium text-4xl">The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Teenagers today are bombarded with political news from various sources, each with its own agenda and perspective. This can make it challenging to separate facts from opinions, identify biases, and understand the implications of different political viewpoints. Misinformation and bias can lead to misunderstandings and reinforce stereotypes, hindering the development of well-informed citizens.
        </p>
        <br>

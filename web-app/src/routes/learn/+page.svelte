	<h1 class="font-medium text-4xl pb-4">What is Media Bias?</h1>

	<p>
		Media bias occurs when the opinions and beliefs of journalists and news organizations affect the
		news that they are reporting.
	</p>

	<p>
		Unfortunately, media bias is unavoidable. Everyone has their own set of experiences and beliefs,
		embedded into their lives. So it is impossible to expect a journalist to completely forget an
		integral part of themselves while writing an article. From the facts that a journalist does and
		doesn't report to the subtle language that they use, a journalist's beliefs will also.
	</p>
	<br />
	<h2 class="h2">What are some types of media bias?</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Partisan Bias:</strong> When a journalist's political views impact news reporting.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Demographic Bias:</strong> When factors like race, gender, or culture affect news coverage.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Corporate Bias:</strong> When business or advertising interests influence story reporting.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>"Big Story" Bias:</strong> When journalists prioritize major events, potentially missing
			key details.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Neutrality Bias:</strong> When attempts to avoid bias lead to factual misrepresentation.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br />
	<h2 class="h2">How Media Bias Affects Us</h2>

	<p>
		In recent years, media bias has been creating more polarization, intolerance of dissent, and
		political segregation. With the advent of social media algorithms, the content that we view
		online has been tailored to our interests. Combined with the biased media that we consume, it is
		no surprise that our society is becoming more and more polarized. These same social media
		algorithms are also reinforcing such beliefs by making it so that only people with similar
		political ideologies interact with each other.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>So what can we do?</strong> As a friend once said, "If you don't find out the facts by yourself,
		someone else will tell them for you." By limiting ourselves to reading from a singular source, we
		allow journalists to form our opinions. Instead, we need to learn methods to help us cut through
		the rhetoric and isolate the salient facts.
	</p>

	<p>
		The first, and most important, step is to understand media bias. Congratulations! By reading
		this article, you are already one step closer to avoiding media bias. Now that you have made it
		so far, it is important to continue your journey by researching and understanding the media bias
		at its core.
	</p>

	<p>
		The main way to combat this issue is to try lateral reading. This is a strategy used by
		professional fact checkers in which they read articles on the same issue on various different
		websites. Not only will this help to have a broader view of the issue at hand, but it will also
		allow you to compare the various articles against one another to verify evidence, contextualize
		information, and find potential weaknesses.
	</p>

	<p>
		Another way to combat this issue is to have more open discussions. Your views and experiences
		will always interfere with your understanding of issues, so by talking to other people with
		different experiences, they may be able to provide a new perspective.
